Welcome to my blog. Thanks to github pages, this is easy!  
In this place, you'll find posts that may relate to Open Source software, DevOps strategies and Linux. You may encounter random content about my personal interests, cars, craft beers, etc.

I have 3 full time jobs that I absolutely love. Husband, father, and team leader at [Inocybe Technologies](https://www.inocybe.com).

I am glad to share technology-related content that I find interesting and exciting with you. Join me along the way on Twitter and LinkedIn :)    
Cheers!
